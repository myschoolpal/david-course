Abstracts and interfaces
------------------------

Abstract Classes:
- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. 
- It is declared using the abstract keyword 
- Can include abstract methods (methods without implementation) 
- Also concrete methods (methods with implementation).
- It serves as a blueprint for other classes, enabling a hierarchical and modular design.

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound(); // Abstract method
    void eat() { // Concrete method
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

How It Works:
- Abstract classes can define methods and properties common to all derived classes,
  ensuring consistency.
- They can declare abstract methods, forcing subclasses to provide their specific 
  implementation.

How It Improves Design:
- Enforces a contract for derived classes, ensuring they implement specific behavior.
- Promotes code reuse by allowing concrete methods that are shared among subclasses.
- Provides flexibility to define default behaviors while allowing customization in subclasses.

Problem of Having No Abstract Classes:
- Code becomes less modular, as there is no structured way to define 
  shared behavior and enforce it across subclasses.
- Developers might duplicate code across different classes, 
  leading to maintenance difficulties and errors.

Why Use Abstract Classes?
- Code Reusability 
- Enforced Design
- Polymorphism.

Rules That Abstract Classes Follow:
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
- Abstract classes can have constructors, concrete methods, and fields.
- Subclasses must either implement all abstract methods or also be declared abstract.
- Abstract methods cannot have a body (implementation) in the abstract class.

Problems with a Concrete Base Class:
- A concrete base class cannot enforce that subclasses must implement specific methods.
- It may allow instantiation of the base class, even if it doesn’t 
  make sense in the application.
- Adding or modifying methods in a concrete base class might require 
  changes to all subclasses, leading to tight coupling.

Examples

Abstract Class with Abstract Method:

abstract class Shape {
    abstract double calculateArea();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    double width, height;

    Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

Concrete Method in Abstract Class:

abstract class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting.");
    }
    abstract void drive();
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving.");
    }
}


Interfaces
----------

Interfaces help achieve abstraction and define contracts for classes to implement. 
They are widely used in design to define behaviors that classes can adopt, 
irrespective of where the class resides in the hierarchy.

Why Use Interfaces:
- Abstraction: 
    Interfaces allow you to define a contract that must be fulfilled.
- Multiple Inheritance: 
    Java doesn't support multiple inheritance but a class can implement 
    multiple interfaces.
- Loose Coupling: 
    Interfaces decouple code, making it easier to modify implementations 
    without affecting the code that depends on the interface.

Basic Design of an Interface:

- Interfaces declare methods but do not provide implementations
- interfaces can have default methods (methods with a body) and static methods.

Example:

public interface Flyable {
    void fly(); // Abstract method
}

An interface can extend other interfaces:

public interface Bird extends Flyable {
    void chirp();
}

Implementation:
- A class uses the implements keyword to implement an interface.
- The class must provide concrete implementations for all
  the abstract methods in the interface unless the class is declared abstract.

Example:

public class Airplane implements Flyable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("The airplane is flying.");
    }
}

A class can implement multiple interfaces:

public class Drone implements Flyable, Operable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("The drone is flying.");
    }

    @Override
    public void operate() {
        System.out.println("The drone is being operated.");
    }
}

Default methods do not need to be implemented:

Interface with Default Method:

public interface Animal {
    void eat(); // Abstract method (must be implemented)

    default void sleep() { // Default method (optional to implement)
        System.out.println("This animal is sleeping.");
    }
}

Implementing Class Without Overriding the Default Method:

public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The dog is eating.");
    }
}
Using the Default Method:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();   // Outputs: The dog is eating.
        dog.sleep(); // Outputs: This animal is sleeping. (default implementation)
    }
}
Implementing Class With Overriding the Default Method:

public class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The cat is eating.");
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("The cat sleeps quietly.");
    }
}

Multiple Interfaces with Conflicting Default Methods:

If a class implements multiple interfaces with the same default method, 
the class must explicitly resolve the conflict by overriding the method.

Example:

public interface A {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("A's default method");
    }
}

public interface B {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("B's default method");
    }
}

public class MyClass implements A, B {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        A.super.show(); // Explicitly choose A's implementation
        System.out.println("MyClass's custom implementation");
    }
}

Naming Convention: 

The Name Should Show the Capabilities the Class Now Has.

Interfaces are often named to describe the capability or behavior they provide, 
using adjectives or verbs.

This naming convention improves code readability and self-documentation.

Its common to name interfaces with an i - iflyable, ioperable etc...

Dependency Injection:

Interfaces are commonly used in dependency injection to decouple
implementation from design.

public interface Logger {
    void log(String message);
}

public class ConsoleLogger implements Logger {
    @Override
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Console log: " + message);
    }
}

public class App {
    private final Logger logger;

    public App(Logger logger) {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    public void run() {
        logger.log("Application is running!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger logger = new ConsoleLogger();
        App app = new App(logger);
        app.run(); // Outputs: Console log: Application is running!
    }
}


Generics
--------

Some dont need to be coded (comparable), but you can write your own. 

Generic interfaces in Java allow developers to define a contract (interface) that can operate on a specific data type specified during implementation. 
They are part of Java's type-safe generic and are crucial for:

Reusability: They allow code to be reused with different data types, reducing redundancy.
Type Safety: Compile-time type checking helps prevent runtime errors.
Flexibility: The same interface can be implemented for multiple types without needing separate interfaces for each type.


implementing custom generic:

public interface Container<T> {
    void add(T item);
    T get();
}


How to Implement Generic Interfaces:
- Specify the type during implementation.
- Use generics in the implementing class.

Example:
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntegerContainer intContainer = new IntegerContainer();
        intContainer.add(42); // Adding an integer
        System.out.println("IntegerContainer contains: " + intContainer.get());

        // Using GenericContainer with String
        GenericContainer<String> stringContainer = new GenericContainer<>();
        stringContainer.add("Hello!"); // Adding a string
        System.out.println("GenericContainer (String) contains: " + stringContainer.get());

        // Using GenericContainer with Double
        GenericContainer<Double> doubleContainer = new GenericContainer<>();
        doubleContainer.add(3.14159); // Adding a double
        System.out.println("GenericContainer (Double) contains: " + doubleContainer.get());
    }
}

interface Container<T> {
    void add(T item);
    T get();
}

class IntegerContainer implements Container<Integer> {
    private Integer item;

    @Override
    public void add(Integer item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    @Override
    public Integer get() {
        return item;
    }
}

class GenericContainer<T> implements Container<T> {
    private T item;

    @Override
    public void add(T item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    @Override
    public T get() {
        return item;
    }
}


comparable (built-in generic interface): 

What Does Comparable Do?
When a class implements the Comparable<T> interface, it can compare its own objects and define their natural order 
(e.g., smallest to largest).

This is useful for sorting, especially with Java tools like Collections.sort().


public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public Student(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.id, other.id); // Compare by ID
    }

    // Getters for id and name (optional)
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}



Sorting a List of Student:


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of students
        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student(3, "Alice"));
        students.add(new Student(1, "Bob"));
        students.add(new Student(2, "Charlie"));

        // Sort the students (uses compareTo)
        Collections.sort(students);

        // Print the sorted list
        for (Student student : students) {
            System.out.println(student.getId() + ": " + student.getName());
        }
    }
}
Output:
1: Bob
2: Charlie
3: Alice

Why Comparable:
Without Comparable, you’d have to write custom sorting logic every time you wanted to sort Student objects. 
By implementing Comparable, you define the "default" way to compare Student objects in one place.
