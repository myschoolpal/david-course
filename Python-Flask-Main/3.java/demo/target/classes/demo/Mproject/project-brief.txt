Brief for Prison Simulator Project
----------------------------------

Objective:
Create a prison simulation program with at least three classes that demonstrates 
your understanding of key object-oriented programming principles including:
- substitution 
- inheritance 
- composition 
- abstract classes 
- interfaces 
- enums
- methods

Requirements
------------

Classes and Inheritance:

Create at least three classes representing entities in your prison simulation.
Use inheritance to create a base class and extend it for specific roles.

Abstract Classes:

Include an abstract class with common properties or methods for prison-related entities.
Subclasses of this abstract class should implement specific behaviors.

Interfaces:

Define an interface that declares behaviors or actions shared across different classes.
Have at least one class implement the interface.

Enums:

Use an enum to represent categories or states in your simulation.

Composition:

Use composition to represent relationships between objects.

Substitution:

Demonstrate substitutability by using a superclass reference to interact with 
subclass objects.

Deliverables
------------

Submit your code with clear comments explaining where each 
OOP principle is demonstrated.

Provide a short write-up (1 paragraph) explaining how you used inheritance, 
composition, substitution, abstract classes, interfaces, and enums in your simulation.

All code to be emailed to me.
