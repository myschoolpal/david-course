  // Here we are returning an <h1> HTML tag with the text "Hello, welcome to React!" inside.
  // This is rendered on the screen when the component is used in the app.
}

// By using 'export default', this component is made available for import in other files.

import { Greeting, Goodbye } from './Greeting';  // Importing by exact names

import { Greeting as WelcomeMessage, Goodbye as FarewellMessage } from './Greeting';

console.log(WelcomeMessage);  // Now this refers to Greeting()
