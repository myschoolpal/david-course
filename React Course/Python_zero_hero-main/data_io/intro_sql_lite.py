import sqlite3

# =================================
# SQLite is serverless, meaning it doesn’t require a separate server process like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
# It stores everything (data, schema, etc.) in a single file, making it easy to set up and move between systems.
# It's ideal for embedded applications, mobile apps, or local storage needs. - Self contained
# Unlike traditional databases, SQLite is dynamically typed. It doesn't enforce data types for columns as strictly as other databases (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
# You can insert values of any type, even if they don’t match the declared column type. For example, you can insert a string into an INTEGER column, and SQLite will store it as a string.
# c.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON")
# =================================

# It's good practice to use 'with' to manage database connections.
# This ensures the connection is automatically closed when done.
# Using 'with' also helps in managing resources properly and avoids memory leaks.

    # It's better to use the "IF NOT EXISTS" clause to prevent errors if the table already exists.
